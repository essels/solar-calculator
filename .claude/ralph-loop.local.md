Follow the instructions in RALPH_PROMPT.md exactly. Before each feature, invoke the Haiku subagent for codebase discovery. Read feature_list.json to understand requirements. Work incrementally, one feature at a time. Update progress.txt with subagent recommendations used and commit after each feature. Output <promise>SOLAR_QUOTE_COMPLETE</promise> when ALL features pass.
